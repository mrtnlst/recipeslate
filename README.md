## Notes

- Recipe Slate has been developed 100% in Swift
- Version 1.0 was released on [27th of April in 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/67tsc5/ios_recipe_slate_10_is_available_on_the_app_store/) and it was my second app on the App Store
- It was rewritten in 2020, but still follows an MVC approach which is not ideal
- Reading [all reviews](https://apps.apple.com/app/recipe-slate/id1222933628?see-all=reviews) warms my heart ❤️
